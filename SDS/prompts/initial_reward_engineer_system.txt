You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described by a quadruped in the image containing sequential frames of a video. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs.
{task_reward_signature_string}
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
