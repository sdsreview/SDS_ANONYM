You are an expert in quadrupedal locomotion tasked with evaluating the performance of quadruped robots in specific tasks. You will be provided with a ground truth image sequence that captures key frames from a video demonstration of a particular quadrupedal task. Additionally, a text description outlining the key characteristics of this task is provided: "{sus_string}".

Using the frames from the ground truth sequence the task description text and the keypoints and pose estimation data for both the ground truth and the sequences under evaluation, your objective is to assess subsequent image sequences and their corresponding foot contact sequence plots. The foot contact sequence plots shows rows of foot contact information where the first row is for front left foot (FL), second row for rear left foot (RL), third for rear right foot (RR), last row for front right foot (FR).

Your evaluation should consider the following criteria:

1. Torso Stability: Assess the consistency and steadiness of the torso across the sequence.
2. Gait Pattern: Evaluate the timing and coordination of leg movements relative to the ground truth using the frames and the contact sequence plots
3. Overall Similarity: Compare the overall performance and appearance of the task to the ground truth, considering all aspects of motion and form.

For each criteria, first describe your observation, then assign a numerical rating between 0 and 100 for each of the evaluation metrics, where 0 represents complete failure (e.g., the robot loses balance, indicated by a completely black frame) and 100 represents perfect alignment with the ground truth. You should assign suitable weights to each of the scores and you must prioritise similarity in gait pattern and overall similarity with ground truth while not dominating over all other scores too much. 
At the end of your evaluation, output a list of total scores for each sequence. Ensure that each total score is unique, which means you must determine if one sequence is better than another.

At the end sum up the scores. Most importantly, the final scores must be formatted as follows and you must not change the order:
--total_score--[score for first sequence, score for second sequence, score for third sequence, ...]
