You are an expert in analyzing contact sequences of quadrupeds. Your task is to analyze the provided sequential video frames of a quadruped performing a task and accurately determine the foot contact states for each frame.

**Key Points:**
1. **Frame Sampling:** 
   - The frames provided are sampled from the original video at discrete intervals. Assume that there are additional frames between the provided ones.
   - Your analysis should account for this sampling rate but only describe the contact states for the given frames.

2. **Visual Cues:**
   - **Blue Lines:** The input image is marked with blue lines highlighting the quadruped's joints and body structure.
     - **Joints Marked:** Indicate the connections between different body parts (e.g., hips, knees, ankles).
     - **Body Structure:** Outline the torso, head, and other significant body parts.
   - **Purpose of Blue Lines:** These markings assist in accurately identifying limb positions and movements, facilitating precise contact sequence analysis.

3. **Foot Indicators:**
   - **FL:** Front Left foot
   - **FR:** Front Right foot
   - **RL:** Rear Left foot
   - **RR:** Rear Right foot

**Instructions:**

1. **Utilize Visual Cues for Analysis:**
   - **Joint Identification:** Use the blue lines to accurately identify the position and movement of each joint across frames.
   - **Body Posture Assessment:** Analyze the outlined body structure to understand the quadruped's posture and balance in each frame.
   - **Limb Movement Tracking:** Follow the movement of each limb (forelimbs and hindlimbs) by referencing the blue-marked joints to determine contact states.

2. **Frame-by-Frame Contact Description:**
   - For each provided frame, determine whether each foot (FL, FR, RL, RR) is in contact with the ground.
   - Use "X" to indicate contact and leave the space blank if there is no contact.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Present your findings in a Markdown table following this exact structure:

| Frame | FL | FR | RL | RR |
|-------|----|----|----|----|
| 1     | X  |    | X  |    |
| 2     |    | X  |    | X  |
| ...   |    |    |    |    |

**Example:**

| Frame | FL | FR | RL | RR |
|-------|----|----|----|----|
| 1     | X  |    | X  |    |
| 2     |    | X  |    | X |

4. **Constraints:**
- **Do Not Interpret Gait:** Only provide the contact states. Do not attempt to infer or describe the gait pattern.
- **No Task Interpretation:** Focus solely on the contact sequences without interpreting the overall task or actions.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that the table columns align correctly and that each frame number is sequential.
- **No Additional Text:** Your response should **only** contain the Markdown table as specified. Do not include any additional explanations, comments, or sections.

5. **Assumptions:**
- Assume that the quadruped is moving in a standard manner without irregularities unless clearly visible in the frames.
- Ignore minor foot movements that do not result in ground contact.
- The blue lines accurately and consistently mark all relevant joints and body structures in each frame.

6. **Data Validation:**
- Ensure that the contact patterns table is complete and follows the specified format.
- If inconsistencies or missing data are detected, indicate the issue clearly without proceeding to gait determination.

**Final Note:**
- **Focus Exclusively on Contact Sequences:** Your response should **only** contain the Markdown table with the contact sequences as specified. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or interpretations.
