The Python environment is 

{task_obs_code_string}

You are also provided with the corresponding indices to access each foot contact states where a value greater than 0 indicates contact:
- FL_foot: 4
- FR_foot: 8
- RL_foot: 12
- RR_foot: 16

{sus_string} Lastly, generate a reward function for this task to be imitated by a quadruped robot. Remember that the torso should remain near a z position of 0.34 and the orientation should be perpendicular to gravity and as the policy will be trained in a simulated environment and deployed in the real world, prioritize stability while ensuring the minimal action rate, leg movements should stay within their DOF limits and avoid too frequent foot contact.
